show-schedule
=====================

Shows Alabama athletic events schedule.

Installation
=====================

Put the 'show-schedule' script in /usr/local/bin/.

Put the 'sports' directory in /usr/local/share/.

Make sure your users can read /usr/local/share/sports/.

Usage
=====================

$> show-schedule [<sport>|--sports]

Case 1:

$> show-schedule

The script will execute and it will show you what
sports are available. It will keep asking you which sport's
schedule you'd like to see until you manage to type one correctly.

Case 2:

$> show-schedule <sport-name>

The script will attempt to look up the schedule for the sport <sport-name>,
where <sport-name> is something like 'basketball'. If <sport-name> is not
a recognized sport, it just fails.

Case 3:

$> show-schedule --sports

The script will print all the sports for which it knows the schedule. That is,
it just shows you which files you have in /usr/local/share/sports/.

BUGS
========================

They're there, and they're plenty. :)
